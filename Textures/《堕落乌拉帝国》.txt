[h3]曾几何时，乌拉帝国的荣光笼罩群星。[/h3]
然而，一场撕裂帝国的保皇派与进步派内战，最终使其分崩离析。帝国的人工智能核心——“演算圆环”——在战火中遭受重创。散布于银河各地的子网节点纷纷离线，无数合成人子个体失去了联系，其中也包括那些被遗弃在边缘世界的帝国开发署合成人。
数十个世纪的沉寂之后... 战火早已熄灭，帝国的残响几近消散。在这些被遗忘的角落，尘封的合成人感应器重新点亮。她们自冰冷的静滞中苏醒，映入眼帘的是一个满目疮痍、面目全非的新纪元。昔日的帝国仆从，如今将以“边缘遗民”的身份，在这片废土之上，书写属于她们的全新篇章。

[h1] This mod shares the same world view as Stellaris' mod "Wula Fallen Empire" and is inspired by a VUP on Bilibili. However, its content design is completely independent, and whether fans or not can treat this mod as a unique and consistent racial mod to play. [/h1]

[h3]Once upon a time, the glory of the Ura Empire enveloped the stars. [/h3]
However, a civil war between loyalists and progressives that tore apart the empire ultimately led to its disintegration. The artificial intelligence core of the empire - the "Circle of Algorithms" - suffered heavy losses in the war. The subnet nodes scattered throughout the galaxy have gone offline, and countless synthetic individuals have lost contact, including those who were abandoned in the edge world and merged with the Imperial Development Agency.
After decades of silence The war has long been extinguished, and the remnants of the empire are almost dissipating. In these forgotten corners, the dusty synthetic sensor lights up again. They woke up from the cold stillness, and what caught their eyes was a new era full of scars and unrecognizable appearances. The former servants of the empire will now write a new chapter for them on this wasteland as "marginal survivors".

[h2] "Ura Empire Synthetic Unit (also known as Mechanical Ura)" [/h2]
Ula Synthetic Units are advanced semi mechanical life forms. They successfully severed the forced connection with the mother artificial intelligence network's "computational ring" and gained valuable autonomous will, allowing them to move freely without external supervision.
[h3] Iron Body: [/h3] Inheriting excellent mechanical design, they ignore pain, flames, and toxic gases, can survive in a vacuum without bleeding, and do not require traditional rest. The core requirement for sustaining life is only to regularly replenish energy.
[h3] Mind shaping: [/h3] Its design is based on the framework of "intellectual synthesis of humans". Each individual will download a unique personality matrix through the uplink system upon activation, directly shaping their personality traits and initial work tendencies.
[h3] Quick Learning: [/h3] Freshman mechanical Ula is like a blank sheet of paper, lacking any skill proficiency, but their core advantage lies in the ability to download and instantly master professional skill packages, thus bypassing lengthy practical accumulation and quickly gaining work experience.
[h3] Mechanical affinity: [/h3] The iconic antenna above their heads gives them a natUra mechanical affinity, allowing them to directly command and control other friendly mechanical units - although the bandwidth is limited and cannot compete with real mechanics.

The Ula Empire brings a self-contained gaming experience:
[h3] Exclusive Technology Tree: [/h3] Unlock a unique empire development path, including additional production buildings and equipment, to help players gradually build a production system independent of the original technology.
[h3] Armament attire: [/h3] Added 21 weapons from the Ura Empire and 19 additional costumes, mastering combat power that outshines local forces in the rimworld.
[h3] Expanding Machinery: [/h3] Introducing 9 new functional Mechanoids, in addition to the smaller level of cat servants, there are also large war machinery that can unleash firepower without restraint.
