背景故事：
曾几何时，乌拉帝国的荣光笼罩群星。然而，一场撕裂帝国的保皇派与进步派内战，最终使其分崩离析。帝国的人工智能核心——“演算圆环”——在战火中遭受重创。散布于银河各地的子网节点纷纷离线，无数合成人子个体失去了联系，其中也包括那些被遗弃在边缘世界的帝国开发署合成人。
数十个世纪的沉寂之后... 战火早已熄灭，帝国的残响几近消散。在这些被遗忘的角落，尘封的合成人感应器重新点亮。她们自冰冷的静滞中苏醒，映入眼帘的是一个满目疮痍、面目全非的新纪元。昔日的帝国仆从，如今将以“边缘遗民”的身份，在这片废土之上，书写属于她们的、关于“乌拉帝国”的全新篇章。

核心种族
乌拉帝国合成人（或称机械乌拉）
乌拉合成人是先进的半机械生命体。她们成功切断了与母体人工智能网络“演算圆环”的强制连接，获得了珍贵的自主意志，无需外部监管即可自由行动。
机械优势： 继承了卓越的机械设计，她们无视痛觉、火焰与毒气，能在真空中生存，不会流血，也无需传统意义上的休息。维持生命的核心需求仅是定期补充能量。
心智塑造： 其设计基于“知性合成人”框架。每个个体在激活时，都会通过上行链路系统下载独特的人格基质，直接塑造其性格特质与初始工作倾向。
快速学习： 新生的机械乌拉如同白纸，不具备任何技能熟练度，但是她们的核心优势在于能下载并瞬间掌握专业技能包，从而绕过漫长的实践积累，极快地获得工作经验。
机械亲和： 头顶的标志性天线赋予了她们天生的机械体亲和力，使其能直接指挥并控制其他友方机械单位——尽管带宽有限，无法媲美真正的机械师。

[h1] This mod shares the same world view as Stellaris' mod "Wula Fallen Empire" and is inspired by a VUP on Bilibili. However, its content design is completely independent, and whether fans or not can treat this mod as a unique and consistent racial mod to play. [/h1]

[h2] 1. The current version focuses on lightweight racial experience, with complete core gameplay. The plan is to continue adding more in-depth content and events as the technology matures.
2. It contains elements of anime art style.
3. Relative justice in the original game environment. [/h2]

[h3]Once upon a time, the glory of the Ura Empire enveloped the stars. [/h3]
However, a civil war between loyalists and progressives that tore apart the empire ultimately led to its disintegration. The artificial intelligence core of the empire - the "Circle of Algorithms" - suffered heavy losses in the war. The subnet nodes scattered throughout the galaxy have gone offline, and countless synthetic individuals have lost contact, including those who were abandoned in the edge world and merged with the Imperial Development Agency.
After decades of silence The war has long been extinguished, and the remnants of the empire are almost dissipating. In these forgotten corners, the dusty synthetic sensor lights up again. They woke up from the cold stillness, and what caught their eyes was a new era full of scars and unrecognizable appearances. The former servants of the empire will now write a new chapter for them on this wasteland as "marginal survivors".

[h2] "Ura Empire Synthetic Unit (also known as Mechanical Ura)" [/h2]
Ula Synthetic Units are advanced semi mechanical life forms. They successfully severed the forced connection with the mother artificial intelligence network's "computational ring" and gained valuable autonomous will, allowing them to move freely without external supervision.
[h3] Iron Body: [/h3] Inheriting excellent mechanical design, they ignore pain, flames, and toxic gases, can survive in a vacuum without bleeding, and do not require traditional rest. The core requirement for sustaining life is only to regularly replenish energy.
[h3] Mind shaping: [/h3] Its design is based on the framework of "intellectual synthesis of humans". Each individual will download a unique personality matrix through the uplink system upon activation, directly shaping their personality traits and initial work tendencies.
[h3] Quick Learning: [/h3] Freshman mechanical Ula is like a blank sheet of paper, lacking any skill proficiency, but their core advantage lies in the ability to download and instantly master professional skill packages, thus bypassing lengthy practical accumulation and quickly gaining work experience.
[h3] Mechanical affinity: [/h3] The iconic antenna above their heads gives them a natUra mechanical affinity, allowing them to directly command and control other friendly mechanical units - although the bandwidth is limited and cannot compete with real mechanics.

The Ula Empire brings a self-contained gaming experience:
[h3] Exclusive Technology Tree: [/h3] Unlock a unique empire development path, including additional production buildings and equipment, to help players gradually build a production system independent of the original technology.
[h3] Armament attire: [/h3] Added 21 weapons from the Ura Empire and 19 additional costumes, mastering combat power that outshines local forces in the rimworld.
[h3] Expanding Machinery: [/h3] Introducing 9 new functional Mechanoids, in addition to the smaller level of cat servants, there are also large war machinery that can unleash firepower without restraint.
